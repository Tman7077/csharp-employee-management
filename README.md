# Overview

This is a simple program, with a few classes, to demonstrate the basics of the C# language.

It is intended to be a basic piece of software that a company manager might use to manage their employee information. This includes adding new employees, editing current ones, and removing ones that have left. Employee IDs are auto-incremented, and information can be displayed for easier editing.

# Development Environment

I used VS code with the C# extension to code this.

# Future Work

- The program does not handle certain formatting things, such as checking for valid filenames or correcting the formatting of a phone number.
- Employee information can literally be anythingâ€” every value could be "bob" and the program would be fine with it.
- Some messages of confirmation or success 0=would be nice, currently it just does the thing and continues on as if nothing happened.
